MIDI Mapper

this is a stand alone MIDI Mapper for Arduino.  It listens for incoming notes and then translates them to specific MIDI commands.  It's really that simple.  You change the notes it listens for and the subsequent commmand.  My mapper was set up for a KORG ES1, so you're commands may differ greatly.
